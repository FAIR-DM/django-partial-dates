## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `PartialDate`, an immutable value for a date known to the year, the month or the day, and
  `Precision`, which says which. A value is built from parts or read from `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM` or
  `YYYY-MM-DD`, and written back as the same text. Values sort in ISO order and are hashable,
  so they work as set members and dictionary keys.
- The package skeleton: packaging, continuous integration and the release flow.
